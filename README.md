# Reservation-System
## Purpose
The intention behind this project is to put together everything i have learnt and make this application as professional as possible, in order to be hired as a jr Java developer.

# Steps of development
## 1. Analysis and design
   * In this step we will gather as much information as we can in order to understand the domain and the system we are gonna build.\
   We will accomplish this by working closely with the **stakeholders** and then will:
     * Define the requirements
     * Identify the actors
     * Define the use cases or user stories (still in debate)
     * Create a DFD for describing the flow of the program.
     * Use UML for modelling the java classes.
    
## 2. Define the Stack and architecture to be used. 
   * In this case we will use Spring (**not Boot**) and Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and adapters)
   * The Spring modules we will work with are:
       * Spring MVC
       * Spring Data Access (JDBC)
       * Spring Data Access (Transaction Management)

## 3. Implementation
* After the design phase is completed, we will begin coding the system by following the defined requirements and architecture.

## 4. Testing

## 5. Deployment
